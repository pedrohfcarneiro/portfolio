I've made my own Particle System and it was incredible!  

I was inspired by a video from an ex-blizzard dev, that talked about modern approaches and optimizations for his Particle System, and i decided i would make my own.  

At work, we use WebGL to build Playable Ads, so i chose to implement my partSys using this API.  

To achieve a scalable system with great performance, even for stone age mobiles, i joined some well-thought abstraction and optimization rendering techniques:  

ðŸŽ† Data Layout: Structure of Arrays (SoA) vs Array of Structures (AoS)  
ðŸŽ† Instanced Rendering  
ðŸŽ† Frustum culling for particle batches  
ðŸŽ† Particle pooling  
ðŸŽ† Particle integration updates running in GPU using Transform Feedback. (GPGPU technique for WebGL2)  
ðŸŽ†Delta modifiers abstraction for per-particle complex behaviour.  

The results were very promising and i added a short demonstration video here.  
I'm looking forward to improve the system even more, with WebGPU, parallelization and other cool stuff.  

Here's the video i mentioned at the beginning, the dev is amazing and is building his own engine, go check his work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahOfNgvQ93Q

This project overview is under construction, soon i'll update with more details of the development process.
