var e=`## Overview  
This is a Deckbuilder Dungeon Crawler in which your imbue your own vital energy into the cards, creating a strong connection between you and your deck. At this dungeon, you may trust nothing but your intuition and your beloved cards.  

## Gameplay  
As a cardmancer, you will build the deck that best suits your playstyle and use custom strategies to overcome the challanges the misterious and dangerous dungeon presents.
